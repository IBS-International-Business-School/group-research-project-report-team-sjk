This research will have a cross-sectional survey to compare the attitudes of Gen Z and Gen X attitudes toward sustainable packaging. This survey is made on google form with 23 questions regarding environmental values, willingness to pay, packaging design preferences, and perceived credibility of sustainability claims. To measure these variables, we have selected Likert-scale questions with five response which are Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Not Sure, Agree, and Strongly Agree and one open ended question for their personal opinions. The target population consists of consumers from Gen Z (born in1997–2012) and Gen X (born in 1965–1980), the form was circulated through different social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp groups, LinkedIn. The sampling technique that we have used is stratified sampling because we're working on subgroups of a population like Gen Z and Gen X. We have in total collected 60 responses for this survey research. To analysis our data we needed to clean it for which we have used python collab. We uploaded the data and removed all the null values, we changed all the Likert scale options into numeric form, used the count code to assess what the number count was for our demographics section. Our population is divided into Gen Z and Gen X, but python also gave us a Gen Y which means people born between (1981 – 1996). But we had to filter it out because we didn’t need it. Once we had clean data, we transferred it to excel and then made a generational, gender, employment status and income distribution count for both Gen Z AND Gen X.
