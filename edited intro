introduction: The research question for this study is “How do consumers’ environmental values, perceived credibility of sustainability claims, and packaging design preferences influence their willingness to pay for sustainably packaged products?”. This research question will make a comparison between the attitudes of two wo generational groups Generation Z (1997-2012) and Generation X (1965-1980) on sustainable packaging. Based on four major components like environmental values which will help us figure out how each generation feels about protecting their environment, reducing waste, supporting eco-friendly products, business who support sustainable packaging. Secondly, we will be looking at willingness to pay which will explore how much extra money each generation is willing to pay for sustainable resources, biodegradable and recyclable packaging thirdly we will explore trust in sustainability claims how much a generation relies upon a business or a product if they have green, eco-friendly or sustainable packaging. And lastly packing design preference, which explains which feature of sustainable packing appeals most to the customer. Our main objective to do survey research is because we're looking into attitudes, preferences and perceptions of people and we can’t perceive these feelings directly, so we need to know their honest opinions on how they feel about sustainable packaging in terms of value, money and trust. So, to know their opinions we have constructed a questionnaire which will help us give a clear picture of how they feel about these three components, and help us quantify their feelings and to make a fair comparison between generation Z and generation X.
