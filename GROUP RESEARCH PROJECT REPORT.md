We have retained a complete set of raw data, including questionnaires (papers completed by hand or record downloaded from the online survey platform), recordings, and/or transcripts of interviews, secondary data, etc., as well as data analysis files and documents. 

## Executive Summary

## Introduction
The research question for this study is “How do gen z and gen x’ environmental values, perceived credibility of sustainability claims, and packaging design preferences influence their willingness to pay for sustainably packaged products?”. This research question will make a comparison between the attitudes of two wo generational groups Generation Z (1997-2012) and Generation X (1965-1980) on sustainable packaging. Based on four major components like environmental values which will help us figure out how each generation feels about protecting their environment, reducing waste, supporting eco-friendly products, business who support sustainable packaging. Secondly, we will be looking at willingness to pay which will explore how much extra money each generation is willing to pay for sustainable resources, biodegradable and recyclable packaging thirdly we will explore trust in sustainability claims how much a generation relies upon a business or a product if they have green, eco-friendly or sustainable packaging. And lastly packing design preference, which explains which feature of sustainable packing appeals most to the customer. Our main objective to do survey research is because we're looking into attitudes, preferences and perceptions of people and we can’t perceive these feelings directly, so we need to know their honest opinions on how they feel about sustainable packaging in terms of value, money and trust. So, to know their opinions we have constructed a questionnaire which will help us give a clear picture of how they feel about these three components, and help us quantify their feelings and to make a fair comparison between generation Z and generation X.

## Methodology
... This research will have a cross-sectional survey to compare the attitudes of Gen Z and Gen X attitudes toward sustainable packaging. This survey is made on google form with 23 questions regarding environmental values, willingness to pay, packaging design preferences, and perceived credibility of sustainability claims. To measure these variables, we have selected Likert-scale questions with five response which are Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Not Sure, Agree, and Strongly Agree and one open ended question for their personal opinions. The target population consists of consumers from Gen Z (born in1997–2012) and Gen X (born in 1965–1980), the form was circulated through different social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp groups, LinkedIn. The sampling technique that we have used is stratified sampling because we're working on subgroups of a population like Gen Z and Gen X. We have in total collected 60 responses for this survey research. To analysis our data we needed to clean it for which we have used python collab. We uploaded the data and removed all the null values, we changed all the Likert scale options into numeric form, used the count code to assess what the number count was for our demographics section. Our population is divided into Gen Z and Gen X, but python also gave us a Gen Y which means people born between (1981 – 1996). But we had to filter it out because we didn’t need it. Once we had clean data, we transferred it to excel and then made a generational, gender, employment status and income distribution count for both Gen Z AND Gen X.
