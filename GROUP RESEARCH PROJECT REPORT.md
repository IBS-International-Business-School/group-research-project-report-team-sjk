We have retained a complete set of raw data, including questionnaires (papers completed by hand or record downloaded from the online survey platform), recordings, and/or transcripts of interviews, secondary data, etc., as well as data analysis files and documents. 

## Executive Summary

## Introduction
The research question for this study is “How do gen z and gen x’ environmental values, perceived credibility of sustainability claims, and packaging design preferences influence their willingness to pay for sustainably packaged products?”. This research question will make a comparison between the attitudes of two wo generational groups Generation Z (1997-2012) and Generation X (1965-1980) on sustainable packaging. Based on four major components like environmental values which will help us figure out how each generation feels about protecting their environment, reducing waste, supporting eco-friendly products, business who support sustainable packaging. Secondly, we will be looking at willingness to pay which will explore how much extra money each generation is willing to pay for sustainable resources, biodegradable and recyclable packaging thirdly we will explore trust in sustainability claims how much a generation relies upon a business or a product if they have green, eco-friendly or sustainable packaging. And lastly packing design preference, which explains which feature of sustainable packing appeals most to the customer. Our main objective to do survey research is because we're looking into attitudes, preferences and perceptions of people and we can’t perceive these feelings directly, so we need to know their honest opinions on how they feel about sustainable packaging in terms of value, money and trust. So, to know their opinions we have constructed a questionnaire which will help us give a clear picture of how they feel about these three components, and help us quantify their feelings and to make a fair comparison between generation Z and generation X.

## Methodology

This research will have a cross-sectional survey to compare the attitudes of Gen Z and Gen X attitudes toward sustainable packaging. This survey is made on google form with 23 questions regarding environmental values, willingness to pay, packaging design preferences, and perceived credibility of sustainability claims. To measure these variables, we have selected Likert-scale questions with five response which are Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Not Sure, Agree, and Strongly Agree and one open ended question for their personal opinions. The target population consists of consumers from Gen Z (born in1997–2012) and Gen X (born in 1965–1980), the form was circulated through different social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp groups, LinkedIn. The sampling technique that we have used is stratified sampling because we're working on subgroups of a population like Gen Z and Gen X. 
We have in total collected 56 responses for this survey research. To analysis our data we needed to clean it for which we have used python collab. We uploaded the data and removed all the null values, we changed all the Likert scale options into numeric form, used the count code to assess what the number count was for our demographics section. Our population is divided into Gen Z and Gen X, but python also gave us a Gen Y which means people born between (1981 – 1996). But we had to filter it out because we didn’t need it. So, after data cleaning we were left with 11 Gen X AND 27 Gen Z. Then we did statistical analysis that included descriptive statistics, independent samples t -test to compare the generations and then data was analyzed in excel.

## Discussion
The findings on environmental values and purchasing behaviors of Generation Z (Gen Z) and Generation X (Gen X) have given us a very vital perspective on how we need to market our sustainably packaged products. The questions related to environmental values and responsibilities showed significant intergenerational differences and, in this relationship, Gen X was leading as compared to Gen Z (Pinho, 2024). To sum up there is an overall increased acceptance of eco-friendly packaging across both generations, which shows that if EcoPack introduces sustainable design packages it will for sure be favorable. However, when it comes to willingness to pay for sustainably packaged products, we thought that gen z would be more willing to sustainability packaged goods based on the recent studies (Gomes, 2023).  However, through our survey answer we came to know that Gen X is significantly more willing to choose eco-friendly products even at a higher price as compared to Gen Z because the economy that we are living in where financial instability is on a rise, gen z’s are struggling to pay more for sustainability packages product . Ecopack’s marketers need to understand that they should introduce and focus more on their Gen X consumers but also keeping in mind that they do have limited purchasing power however their packaging strategies should focus affordability and more suitable pricing options like tax credit and discounts (Elgammal, 2024). If we talk about credibility, Greenwashing and Trust both generations show high skepticism, strongly agreeing that companies often exaggerate sustainability claims (greenwashing). This usually happens because businesses are not often clear about their product, packaging, ingredients where they are sourced from and often make big claims which when proven they are not true. So, businesses need to be transparent and be sure about their claims to build their customers trust (Mohammad, 2025). Through our survey we concluded that Gen X is more skeptical about companies pretending to be eco-friendly for marketing because they have experienced a vast amount of marketing trends about greenwashing and sustainability so now, they think that business often exaggerates rather than providing accurate facts and figures. For further implication we as Ecopack data analyst would come up with a streamlined marketing strategy for both generation which includes that for Gen X the sustainability packaging should have strong transparent moral values with evidences also properly show casing how everything sourced and making a difference and for Gen Z the pricing strategies need to be revised in form of premiums, discounts and student programs. Moreover, the regulatory bodies also need to enforce strict rules and regulations, focus on sustainability goals and certifications so that the overall system is moving smoothly (Nichols, 2023).
